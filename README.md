# Activity Reports

This repository is used for the submission of various payment and funding requests including those listed below.

### Timesheets

All team members are eligible to submit a timesheet each day. This is a record of all tasks that the team member worked 
on that day. Once a timesheet has been reviewed and work verified, payment will be sent.

### Bounty Account Refills

For any teams that use the bounty system, the related team lead will manage a bounty account. When the funds in a 
team's bounty account are depleted the team lead may request additional funding.
